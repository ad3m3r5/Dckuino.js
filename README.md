# Dckuino.js
Simple **DuckyScript** to **Arduino** converter.

Improvements and changes have been made to fit my use-case. Some changes are the UI, filename (from d4n5h), removal of locale settings, and bug fixes.

Based on [Nurrl](https://nurrl.github.io/Duckuino/) and [d4n5h](https://github.com/d4n5h/Duckuino)'s improvements on the original Dckuino.js.

### Warning: Release note
